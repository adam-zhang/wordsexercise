Socks.

61
00:04:23,589 --> 00:04:27,559
This was one of the first times
your mum and me went to London.

62
00:04:27,593 --> 00:04:29,428
God, the shops.

63
00:04:29,461 --> 00:04:31,597
We used to look
at all the clothes.

64
00:04:31,630 --> 00:04:33,465
Liberty. Selfridges.

65
00:04:33,499 --> 00:04:35,100
Carnaby street.

66
00:04:35,134 --> 00:04:37,078
The snooty shopgirls knew
we couldn't afford anything,

67
00:04:37,102 --> 00:04:39,171
but they didn't know
we could copy it.

68
00:04:41,273 --> 00:04:42,441
Take it.

69
00:04:42,474 --> 00:04:44,143
No, I can't, gran.

70
00:04:44,976 --> 00:04:46,445
Bring her up when I'm settled.

71
00:04:46,478 --> 00:04:49,615
We'll have dinner at the
criterion, like in the photo.

72
00:04:49,648 --> 00:04:51,450
We didn't eat there.
Couldn't afford to.

73
00:04:51,483 --> 00:04:53,951
Just took a picture outside
and went to a wimpy.

74
00:04:53,985 --> 00:04:57,222
When I'm a big-time
fashion designer, we'll go.

75
00:04:57,256 --> 00:04:58,457
Deal?

76
00:04:58,490 --> 00:05:00,858
I don't think wimpy still exist.

77
00:05:00,892 --> 00:05:03,228
You know what I mean.

78
00:05:05,164 --> 00:05:07,366
I know how much you want this.

79
00:05:07,399 --> 00:05:08,600
It was her dream, too,

80
00:05:08,634 --> 00:05:10,469
but it's not
what you imagine, London.

81
00:05:10,502 --> 00:05:11,936
Gran.

82
00:05:11,969 --> 00:05:13,214
You've got to look out
for yourself.

83
00:05:13,238 --> 00:05:15,040
- I know.
- But I'm gonna say it anyway.

84
00:05:15,074 --> 00:05:16,651
- There are lots of bad guys.
- You've got to be careful.

85
00:05:16,675 --> 00:05:18,453
- There's lots of bad people.
- I'll be careful.

86
00:05:18,477 --> 00:05:19,877
They're bad apples.

87
00:05:19,911 --> 00:05:23,115
I'm scrappy. I can take 'em.

88
00:05:25,684 --> 00:05:29,121
I'm just saying,
London can be a lot.

89
00:05:29,154 --> 00:05:31,490
It was too much
for your mum, perhaps,

90
00:05:31,523 --> 00:05:34,493
and she didn't have your gift.

91
00:05:34,526 --> 00:05:36,161
My gift?

92
00:05:36,195 --> 00:05:39,631
She didn't feel things,
see things like you do.

93
00:05:39,665 --> 00:05:43,135
I... I worry you'll get
all overwhelmed again.

94
00:05:43,168 --> 00:05:47,272
Gran, it's... it's not just
that I need to do this for me.

95
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:53,010
I really want to, for her.

96
00:05:53,645 --> 00:05:55,980
And maybe it won't be so bad.

97
00:05:56,013 --> 00:05:59,418
Maybe up there, I won't be
reminded of her so much.

98
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:03,255
Okay.

99
00:06:03,288 --> 00:06:04,956
Besides...

100
00:06:04,989 --> 00:06:07,992
I haven't even seen mum in ages.

101
00:06:24,710 --> 00:06:26,911
Bye.

102
00:06:35,053 --> 00:06:36,954
You'll call?

103
00:06:36,988 --> 00:06:38,290
You know I will.

104
00:06:38,323 --> 00:06:40,492
And if it all gets
too much in there,

105
00:06:40,526 --> 00:06:41,527
you'll tell me?

106
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:43,262
In the city?

107
00:06:43,295 --> 00:06:44,530
In here.

108
00:06:44,563 --> 00:06:46,165
Please don't do that
to yourself.

109
00:06:46,198 --> 00:06:48,567
Don't do it to me, okay?

110
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:50,469
I love you.

111
00:06:52,337 --> 00:06:54,206
Oh, Ellie.

112
00:06:57,776 --> 00:07:00,646
I want us both to be there.

London college of fashion.

138
00:08:21,426 --> 00:08:23,395

139
00:08:23,428 --> 00:08:25,364
No.

140
00:08:25,397 --> 00:08:26,732
I design clothes.

141
00:08:26,765 --> 00:08:28,534

I'll get out here.

152
00:08:49,254 --> 00:08:50,798
Oh, no, it's a couple
more streets, love.

153
00:08:50,822 --> 00:08:52,424
No, I haven't got enough cash.

154
00:08:52,457 --> 00:08:54,135
Oh, I'm sure we could sort
something out, sweetheart.

155
00:08:54,159 --> 00:08:56,094
Plus, it's not good
round here at night

156
00:08:56,128 --> 00:08:57,138
for young girls on their own.

157
00:08:57,162 --> 00:08:58,463
I want to go to the shop anyway.

00:09:15,781 --> 00:09:18,083
Uh, sorry.

162
00:09:36,835 --> 00:09:38,637
Hey, do you want a hand?

163
00:09:38,670 --> 00:09:40,172
Fine.

164
00:09:40,205 --> 00:09:42,207
You don't look fine.

165
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:44,142
Well, I am.

166
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:53,819
- Are you Eloise?
- Yeah.

167
00:09:53,852 --> 00:09:55,787
Yeah, you-you look
like an Eloise.

168
00:09:55,821 --> 00:09:57,623
Well, Ellie.

169
00:09:57,656 --> 00:09:59,591
I'm jocasta.

170
00:09:59,625 --> 00:10:01,436
Did they spell your surname
wrong or something?

171
00:10:01,460 --> 00:10:03,571
Oh, no, I've just decided
to drop it because I feel like

172
00:10:03,595 --> 00:10:04,930
it's way more singular
to be known

173
00:10:04,963 --> 00:10:06,398
by just your Christian name.

174
00:10:06,431 --> 00:10:08,233
You know, like,
so famous in your work

175
00:10:08,266 --> 00:10:09,835
that you can actually
just go by Kylie.

176
00:10:09,868 --> 00:10:11,903
- Minogue?
- Jenner.

177
00:10:11,937 --> 00:10:13,505
Oh.

178
00:10:13,538 --> 00:10:16,642
Okay, bad example, but...
How many jocastas do you know?

179
00:10:16,675 --> 00:10:17,709
None.

180
00:10:17,743 --> 00:10:19,378
Exactly, babes.

181
00:10:20,612 --> 00:10:23,515
You don't mind I snagged
the bed by the window, do you?

182
00:10:23,548 --> 00:10:25,517
- No.
- If we don't end up throttling each other,

183
00:10:25,550 --> 00:10:27,686
we could maybe talk about
switching next term.

184
00:10:27,719 --> 00:10:28,920
Yeah.

185
00:10:28,954 --> 00:10:31,189
- So, where are you from?
- Uh, redruth.

186
00:10:31,223 --> 00:10:32,524
It's in cornwall.

187
00:10:32,557 --> 00:10:33,458
I'm sorry.

188
00:10:33,492 --> 00:10:36,194
You know, cornwall,
in the countryside.

189
00:10:36,228 --> 00:10:37,305
No, no, I-I heard you, babes.

190
00:10:37,329 --> 00:10:38,630
I'm just, I'm sorry.

191
00:10:39,698 --> 00:10:41,733
Uh...

192
00:10:41,767 --> 00:10:43,301
What about you?

193
00:10:43,335 --> 00:10:44,936
Manchester originally,
but I, uh,

194
00:10:44,970 --> 00:10:46,705
moved down here in my gap year.

195
00:10:46,738 --> 00:10:49,408
Uh, I had an internship
at an atelier in savile row.

196
00:10:49,441 --> 00:10:52,944
Oh, wow. I've just been in
redruth making my own clothes.

197
00:10:52,978 --> 00:10:55,414
I had a hunch you made that.

198
00:10:55,447 --> 00:10:57,549
Yeah, this is bouchra jarrar.

199
00:10:57,582 --> 00:11:00,318
Before she sold out
and moved to lanvin, obviously.

200
00:11:00,352 --> 00:11:01,920
- Smoke?
- No.

201
00:11:01,953 --> 00:11:03,555
Is it allowed in here?

202
00:11:03,588 --> 00:11:06,391
Oh, I-I just took
the batteries out of the alarm.

203
00:11:06,425 --> 00:11:09,828
I can go outside if you really
have a problem with it.

204
00:11:09,861 --> 00:11:11,329
No.

205
00:11:11,363 --> 00:11:12,831
- No, it's fine.
- I tried vaping.

206
00:11:12,864 --> 00:11:16,601
I just think it makes you look
like so much more of a cunt.

207
00:11:16,635 --> 00:11:18,737
Yeah, totally.

208
00:11:20,839 --> 00:11:22,708
So, what does your dad do?

209
00:11:22,741 --> 00:11:24,342
Uh, I don't know him.

210
00:11:24,376 --> 00:11:26,311
Oh, tell me about it.

211
00:11:26,344 --> 00:11:28,313
- And your mum?
- My mother's dead.

212
00:11:28,346 --> 00:11:31,850
Well, I knew we'd find
some common ground eventually.

213
00:11:31,883 --> 00:11:34,986
Yeah, I was only 15
when she died.

214
00:11:35,020 --> 00:11:36,621
What about you?

215
00:11:36,655 --> 00:11:37,956
Seven.

216
00:11:37,989 --> 00:11:39,458
Oh, wow, that is young.

217
00:11:39,491 --> 00:11:42,294
Although I guess
it's maybe easier at that age.

218
00:11:43,762 --> 00:11:46,732
Not that it's a competition,
though, is it?

219
00:11:49,668 --> 00:11:52,237
Ooh, fresh blood!

220
00:11:57,776 --> 00:12:00,746
Oh, my god, wow, is that
a bloody bouchra jarrar?

221
00:12:00,779 --> 00:12:02,547
Oh, good eye.

222
00:12:02,581 --> 00:12:04,792
Yeah, well, before she sold out
and moved to lanvin, obviously.

223
00:12:04,816 --> 00:12:06,017
- Yeah.
- Obviously.

224
00:12:06,052 --> 00:12:07,018
Oh.

225
00:12:07,053 --> 00:12:09,387
Oh, this is my roomie, Eloise.

226
00:12:09,421 --> 00:12:10,722
Hi.

227
00:12:10,756 --> 00:12:13,492
Yeah, she literally made
the outfit she's wearing.

228
00:12:13,525 --> 00:12:16,495
How amazing. All of us
turn up in our Sunday best,

229
00:12:16,528 --> 00:12:18,497
and she's here
rocking her own design.

230
00:12:19,631 --> 00:12:21,509
I'm thinking we should call her
brass balls Ellie.

231
00:12:21,533 --> 00:12:23,001
And what will we call you?

232
00:12:23,035 --> 00:12:24,636
Oh, well, by tomorrow morning,

233
00:12:24,669 --> 00:12:26,638
you'll know me only
as hurricane jocasta.

234
00:12:26,671 --> 00:12:29,007
Ooh. So you guys know
each other from before?

235
00:12:29,041 --> 00:12:30,542
Oh, yeah, we go way back.

236
00:12:30,575 --> 00:12:32,078
What is it, like 15 minutes?

237
00:12:32,111 --> 00:12:33,945
Yeah, something like that.

238
00:12:33,979 --> 00:12:36,048
We're in the dead mums club.

239
00:12:36,082 --> 00:12:38,050
- Oh.
- Fuck leukemia, am I right?

240
00:12:38,084 --> 00:12:40,485
- That's awful.
- Yeah.

241
00:12:40,519 --> 00:12:41,920
It's pretty shit.
I'm not gonna lie.

242
00:12:41,953 --> 00:12:44,923
But, I don't know, I feel like
it kind of fuels my work.

243
00:12:44,956 --> 00:12:45,991
- So...
- Mm-hmm.

244
00:12:46,024 --> 00:12:48,060
What happened to your mum?

245
00:12:48,094 --> 00:12:51,797
Uh, she wasn't well... mentally.

246
00:12:53,832 --> 00:12:56,535
She... she killed herself.

247
00:12:56,568 --> 00:12:58,703
Sorry.

248
00:12:58,737 --> 00:13:01,006
We shouldn't have asked.

249
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:02,607
It was a long time ago.

250
00:13:02,641 --> 00:13:05,544
- You're, like, so brave.
- So brave.

251
00:13:05,577 --> 00:13:08,346
Yeah, I had a-a great-uncle
commit suicide... hung himself.

252
00:13:08,380 --> 00:13:09,581
Oh, god.

253
00:13:09,614 --> 00:13:11,583
So, yeah, I know exactly
what it's like.

254
00:13:11,616 --> 00:13:13,485
Also so brave.

255
00:13:13,518 --> 00:13:15,020
- So brave also.
- Yeah.

256
00:13:15,054 --> 00:13:16,454
Mm.

257
00:13:19,491 --> 00:13:21,459
First rodeo, Ellie?

258
00:13:23,528 --> 00:13:25,864
Got to Mark
your territory, babes.

259
00:13:27,099 --> 00:13:29,501
- Ooh.
- Oh.

260
00:13:29,534 --> 00:13:31,903
Time to break out the big guns.

261
00:13:31,937 --> 00:13:33,772
Let's really get on this bitch.

262
00:13:33,805 --> 00:13:36,575
Do we really want to be
hungover on our first day?

263
00:13:36,608 --> 00:13:38,710
Oh, hush.
That's future you talking.

264
00:13:38,743 --> 00:13:40,645
You know what, fuck her.

265
00:13:40,679 --> 00:13:42,981
You've got to live
in the now, girls.

266
00:13:43,014 --> 00:13:45,717
So, hos...

267
00:13:45,750 --> 00:13:47,153
To soho.

268
00:13:47,186 --> 00:13:49,055
To soho.

269
00:13:49,088 --> 00:13:51,123
To soho.

270
00:13:52,490 --> 00:13:54,926
Come on, Ellie. Keep up.

271
00:13:57,629 --> 00:14:00,498
You're gonna love it!

272
00:14:04,070 --> 00:14:06,371
Let's go!

273
00:14:07,572 --> 00:14:09,941
I dated an Irish guy twice.

274
00:14:09,975 --> 00:14:12,777
Well, like, the-the same guy
but, like, two separate times.

275
00:14:12,811 --> 00:14:15,013
- Oh.
- Yeah. Yeah.

276
00:14:15,047 --> 00:14:16,481
And, yeah, he was Irish.

277
00:14:16,514 --> 00:14:18,516
Yeah, and, I don't know,
I kind of feel like

278
00:14:18,550 --> 00:14:20,018
I kind of get the culture.

279
00:14:20,052 --> 00:14:21,419
Watch and learn, guys.

280
00:14:21,453 --> 00:14:22,687
And I just love Ireland.

281
00:14:22,721 --> 00:14:24,123
Like, he literally
introduced me...

282
00:14:24,156 --> 00:14:25,557
Um, excuse me, miss.

283
00:14:25,590 --> 00:14:27,626
Um, my dick just died.

284
00:14:27,659 --> 00:14:29,561
Can I Bury it in your arse?

285
00:14:29,594 --> 00:14:31,529
- Ew, absolutely not.
- Get away.

286
00:14:31,563 --> 00:14:32,898
That's disgusting.

287
00:14:32,931 --> 00:14:35,000
Oh, you should try
that line on Eloise.

288
00:14:35,034 --> 00:14:36,468
I bet she's complete filth

289
00:14:36,501 --> 00:14:38,204
once you get a few drinks
inside her.

290
00:14:38,237 --> 00:14:39,671
Okay. Okay.

291
00:14:39,704 --> 00:14:40,906
What?

292
00:14:40,939 --> 00:14:42,908
- Oh, come on, play the game.
- Aw. - Ellie.

293
00:15:02,228 --> 00:15:05,931
Freshers...
They're a blessing and a curse.

294
00:15:14,940 --> 00:15:17,209
It's just a bit shit.
I'm just like...

295
00:15:17,243 --> 00:15:19,644
She's such a code beige,
I'm getting these, like,

296
00:15:19,678 --> 00:15:22,048
born-again Christian vibes
off her.

297
00:15:22,081 --> 00:15:23,615
Who, country mouse?

298
00:15:23,648 --> 00:15:25,217
She comes to
her first day at lcf

299
00:15:25,251 --> 00:15:26,818
wearing clothes
she fucking made.

300
00:15:26,851 --> 00:15:28,653
Yeah, that was a bit much.

301
00:15:28,687 --> 00:15:29,964
Bringing up
her mum's suicide... I'm sorry,

302
00:15:29,988 --> 00:15:31,766
but, like, who the fuck
does that for attention?

303
00:15:31,790 --> 00:15:33,101
- Yeah, right.
- She's a bit weird.

304
00:15:33,125 --> 00:15:33,959
She's a lot fucking weird.

305
00:15:33,992 --> 00:15:35,227
I'd lay bets on her

306
00:15:35,261 --> 00:15:36,701
slashing her wrists
before Christmas.

307
00:15:37,729 --> 00:15:38,897
You can't say that.

308
00:15:38,930 --> 00:15:40,699
- It's true.
- Jocasta!

309
00:15:40,732 --> 00:15:42,277
Come on. We've got
another three pubs to hit

310
00:15:42,301 --> 00:15:43,902

Didn't you put on that techno
<i>riverdance</i> shit at the toucan?

333
00:17:43,721 --> 00:17:45,957
All yours.

334
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:49,961
Don't pay any attention to him.

335
00:17:49,994 --> 00:17:53,165
- I'm John, by the way.
- Ellie.

336
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:55,367
Oh, shit.

337
00:17:55,401 --> 00:17:58,104
Uh, this is your can, isn't it?

338
00:17:58,137 --> 00:17:59,138
Have it.

339
00:18:19,425 --> 00:18:21,160
No, no, no, no!

340
00:18:36,475 --> 00:18:38,877
- Yasmine Rogers?
- Here.

341
00:18:39,744 --> 00:18:42,148
- Gemma boker?
- Here.

342
00:18:42,181 --> 00:18:43,915

343
00:18:43,948 --> 00:18:45,117
Here.

344
00:18:46,085 --> 00:18:47,453
Eloise Turner?

345
00:18:47,486 --> 00:18:49,288
It's Ellie.

346
00:18:49,321 --> 00:18:51,756
Uh, sorry.
What was the question?

347
00:18:51,789 --> 00:18:53,658
Are you present?

348
00:18:54,426 --> 00:18:55,827
Yeah.

349
00:18:55,860 --> 00:18:58,430
- Serena lowe?
- Here.

350
00:18:58,464 --> 00:19:00,332
Jack sharp?

351
00:19:00,366 --> 00:19:03,902
So, how's
my big-time fashion designer?

352
00:19:03,935 --> 00:19:05,437
I'm good. I'm good.

353
00:19:05,471 --> 00:19:07,872
And did you wow them all?

354
00:19:07,906 --> 00:19:10,775
- I don't know, gran.
- I bet you did.

355
00:19:10,808 --> 00:19:12,378
Anyway, you still
haven't told me

356
00:19:12,411 --> 00:19:14,180
anything about your place.

357
00:19:14,213 --> 00:19:15,780
It's great.

358
00:19:15,813 --> 00:19:17,316
Very modern.

359
00:19:17,349 --> 00:19:18,950
And how's your roommate?

360
00:19:18,983 --> 00:19:21,120
- Jocasta.
- Is she nice?

361
00:19:21,153 --> 00:19:23,922
- Yeah, yeah, she's fun.
- How lovely.

362
00:19:23,955 --> 00:19:25,757
I say pub crawl, round two.

363
00:19:25,790 --> 00:19:27,059
Almost too much fun.

364
00:19:27,092 --> 00:19:28,494
Well, that's wonderful.

365
00:19:28,527 --> 00:19:30,728
I-I thought maybe
you'd need more time

366
00:19:30,762 --> 00:19:33,731
to get used to being around
so many people.

367
00:19:33,765 --> 00:19:35,800
It's not all too much, is it?

368
00:19:35,833 --> 00:19:37,369
No, I'm okay.

369
00:19:37,403 --> 00:19:39,737
I can't wait to come down
and see you.

370
00:19:39,771 --> 00:19:41,806
- When you feel more at home.
- Yeah.

371
00:19:41,839 --> 00:19:44,043
When I feel more at home.

372
00:19:47,011 --> 00:19:49,215
<i>Soho 0827.</i>

373
00:19:49,248 --> 00:19:51,950
<i>Hi. I saw your advert
for a room to rent.</i>

374
00:19:51,983 --> 00:19:53,485
<i>Yes?</i>

375
00:19:53,519 --> 00:19:55,421
<i>Uh, I'd like to rent it.</i>

376
00:19:55,454 --> 00:19:56,988
<i>Do you know goodge street?</i>

377
00:19:57,021 --> 00:19:59,091
<i>Uh, no, but I can find it.</i>

378
00:19:59,124 --> 00:20:01,493
<i>Well, it's 8 goodge place.</i>

379
00:20:01,527 --> 00:20:04,396
<i>Press the buzzer for Collins.</i>

380
00:20:06,498 --> 00:20:08,967
Just coming, deary.

381
00:20:10,868 --> 00:20:12,837
- Ms. Collins?
- Yes.

382
00:20:12,870 --> 00:20:15,006
It's Ellie.
We spoke on the phone.

383
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:16,741
Oh, yes.

384
00:20:17,476 --> 00:20:20,212
Room is on the top floor.

385
00:20:20,246 --> 00:20:22,248
I've a few rules.

386
00:20:22,281 --> 00:20:24,049
Don't take smokers.

387
00:20:24,083 --> 00:20:25,251
I don't smoke.

388
00:20:25,284 --> 00:20:28,420
No male visitors after 8:00.

389
00:20:28,454 --> 00:20:30,021
Not a problem.

390
00:20:30,055 --> 00:20:32,824
And no using
the laundry room at night.

391
00:20:32,857 --> 00:20:34,926
It rattles
right through to mine.

392
00:20:34,959 --> 00:20:36,828
- I don't do laundry.
- Eh?

393
00:20:36,861 --> 00:20:40,032
I mean...
I don't do nighttime laundry.

394
00:20:40,065 --> 00:20:41,533
I do do laundry. I'm very clean.

395
00:20:41,567 --> 00:20:42,834
Good.

396
00:20:45,471 --> 00:20:47,506
It's a bit old-fashioned
for some,

397
00:20:47,539 --> 00:20:49,341
but I won't do nothing to it.

398
00:20:49,375 --> 00:20:52,177
If you don't like it,
you can find somewhere else.

399
00:20:52,211 --> 00:20:53,545
It's perfect.

400
00:20:53,579 --> 00:20:55,214
I love it.

401
00:20:55,247 --> 00:20:58,150
Bed, kitchenette, bathroom.

402
00:20:58,183 --> 00:21:00,586
You won't have to worry
about it until the summer,

403
00:21:00,619 --> 00:21:03,322
but then you'll have to
keep the plugs in

404
00:21:03,355 --> 00:21:05,823
'cause all the smells rise up.

405
00:21:05,857 --> 00:21:07,426
How long have you lived here?

406
00:21:07,459 --> 00:21:10,062
Oh, a long while.

407
00:21:10,095 --> 00:21:13,465
I used to work here,
cleaning and such,

408
00:21:13,499 --> 00:21:16,834
back when round here
was a bad spot.

409
00:21:16,868 --> 00:21:19,305
I bought it for buttons
off the old owner.

410
00:21:19,338 --> 00:21:21,040
Must be worth a lot now.

411
00:21:21,073 --> 00:21:22,907
Oh, I could never sell it.

412
00:21:22,940 --> 00:21:24,942
Too many memories.

413
00:21:25,577 --> 00:21:27,413
Yeah.

414
00:21:30,082 --> 00:21:32,084
If I could live any place
and any time,

415
00:21:32,117 --> 00:21:34,852
I'd live here in London
in the '60s.

416
00:21:34,886 --> 00:21:37,523
It must have felt like
the center of the universe.

417
00:21:37,556 --> 00:21:39,891
I hope you know
what a landline is.

418
00:21:39,924 --> 00:21:41,593
Some of your lot don't.

419
00:21:41,627 --> 00:21:43,961
- Course.
- Don't get too excited.

420
00:21:43,995 --> 00:21:46,065
It only makes emergency calls.

421
00:21:46,098 --> 00:21:48,467
Oh, and I hope you like garlic.

422
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:50,135
Yeah.

423
00:21:50,169 --> 00:21:52,937
There's a French bistro
next door.

424
00:21:52,970 --> 00:21:57,042
Pretty soon, you won't be able
to smell anything else.

425
00:22:01,647 --> 00:22:04,383
<i>So, when you looking to move in?</i>

426
00:22:04,416 --> 00:22:07,119
As soon as possible.

427
00:22:07,152 --> 00:22:08,620
You're not in any trouble,
are you?

428
00:22:08,654 --> 00:22:10,021
No.

429
00:22:10,055 --> 00:22:12,591
No, I just need, uh, an escape.

430
00:22:12,624 --> 00:22:14,959
Oh, don't we all, deary.

431
00:22:14,992 --> 00:22:17,062
What's your line of work?

432
00:22:17,096 --> 00:22:19,398
I'm a student, but I have
a loan and a bursary.

433
00:22:19,431 --> 00:22:21,400
Well, what do you study?

434
00:22:21,433 --> 00:22:22,634
Fashion.

435
00:22:22,668 --> 00:22:24,370
Ah. Interesting.

436
00:22:24,403 --> 00:22:26,271
Yeah. My gran's a seamstress,

437
00:22:26,305 --> 00:22:28,973
and my mum is...
Was in the industry, too.

438
00:22:29,006 --> 00:22:31,043
And you're sure you'll be able
to make the rent?

439
00:22:31,076 --> 00:22:33,412
Mm-hmm. Yeah, I'll make it work.

440
00:22:33,445 --> 00:22:35,913
I do ask more
than your average landlady.

441
00:22:35,947 --> 00:22:37,649
I want two months rent
in advance

442
00:22:37,683 --> 00:22:39,651
and two months deposit.

443
00:22:39,685 --> 00:22:41,520
- Okay.
- I've had people

444
00:22:41,553 --> 00:22:44,256
just take off in the middle
of the night. That's why.

445
00:22:44,289 --> 00:22:46,158
Ms. Collins...

446
00:22:47,159 --> 00:22:49,428

Hello.
You're a gorgeous creature.

489
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:56,775
- What's your name?
- Sandie.

490
00:26:56,808 --> 00:26:58,410
Care to join
my friends and I, sandie?

491
00:26:58,443 --> 00:27:00,912
Thanks, but I'm here
to meet the owner.

492
00:27:00,946 --> 00:27:02,648
I am the owner.

493
00:27:02,681 --> 00:27:06,218
Oh, I doubt that.

494
00:27:06,251 --> 00:27:08,720
I'm whatever
you want me to be, sandie.

495
00:27:21,733 --> 00:27:22,934
What's your poison, miss?

496
00:27:22,968 --> 00:27:25,203
I'm not here to drink, actually.

497
00:27:25,237 --> 00:27:26,705
I want to speak to the owner.

498
00:27:26,738 --> 00:27:27,939
Owner's not in tonight.

499
00:27:27,973 --> 00:27:29,517
What do you want
to speak to them about?

500
00:27:29,541 --> 00:27:31,877
I want to be
your new headline act.

501
00:27:31,910 --> 00:27:34,212
- Where have you played before?
- Nowhere.

502
00:27:34,246 --> 00:27:36,615
Who starts at the cafe de Paris?

503
00:27:36,648 --> 00:27:38,550
Me.

504
00:27:39,551 --> 00:27:41,520
I can take your name
if you want,

505
00:27:41,553 --> 00:27:43,689
but maybe you should speak
to Jack in the meantime.

506
00:27:43,722 --> 00:27:45,557
Jack?

507
00:27:45,590 --> 00:27:46,391
Over there.

508
00:27:46,425 --> 00:27:48,694
The guy standing
next to cilla black.

509
00:27:48,727 --> 00:27:51,229
Brilliant, cilla.
Honestly, what a performance.

510
00:27:51,263 --> 00:27:52,698
He manages a lot of girls.

511
00:28:11,016 --> 00:28:13,518
Well, hello there.

512
00:28:14,619 --> 00:28:16,588
The bartender said
I should get to know

513
00:28:16,621 --> 00:28:18,824
the handsome fella
standing next to cilla black.

514
00:28:18,857 --> 00:28:20,025
You should.

515
00:28:20,059 --> 00:28:21,660
And you are?

516
00:28:21,693 --> 00:28:24,429
The next cilla black.

517
00:28:26,364 --> 00:28:28,400
Are you, now?

518
00:28:28,433 --> 00:28:31,369
Well, you know, she started out
as a coat check girl.

519
00:28:31,403 --> 00:28:33,472
You willing to work your way up?

520
00:28:33,505 --> 00:28:34,873
Of course.

521
00:28:34,906 --> 00:28:36,875
What can I get you to drink?

522
00:28:36,908 --> 00:28:39,344
It's sandie,
and I'd love a vesper.

523
00:28:39,377 --> 00:28:40,946
James, we'd love a vesper.

524
00:28:45,051 --> 00:28:47,652
So, what do you do, sandie?

525
00:28:47,686 --> 00:28:49,855
Well, I sing, of course.

526
00:28:49,888 --> 00:28:51,757
How's your dancing?

527
00:28:51,790 --> 00:28:54,259
Care for a demonstration?

528
00:28:59,331 --> 00:29:00,766
Here we go.

529
00:30:09,467 --> 00:30:11,636
Your thoughts?

530
00:30:11,670 --> 00:30:13,839
You're already a star.

531
00:30:13,872 --> 00:30:17,542
But you could be an old lady
before you get onstage here.

532
00:30:17,576 --> 00:30:19,611
How about I get you a gig
somewhere this week?

533
00:30:19,644 --> 00:30:21,613
- You could do that?
- I could, indeed.

534
00:30:21,646 --> 00:30:23,882
But first,
let me get your vesper.

535
00:30:28,154 --> 00:30:30,388
- Do I get a dance now?
- Afraid not.

536
00:30:30,422 --> 00:30:32,023
Oh, you looked up for it
just then.

537
00:30:32,058 --> 00:30:34,526
I'm just waiting for my friend
Jack to get my drink.

538
00:30:34,559 --> 00:30:37,596
- Well, I'm sure Jack won't mind.
- I mind.

539
00:30:37,629 --> 00:30:39,965
Now, don't pretend
you don't love the attention.

540
00:30:39,998 --> 00:30:41,566
Is this man bothering you?

541
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:43,444
I was just asking
our friend sandie for a dance.

542
00:30:43,468 --> 00:30:44,636
Her card is full right now.

543
00:30:44,669 --> 00:30:45,971

544
00:30:46,004 --> 00:30:47,739
Don't hog her all night.

00:30:47,772 --> 00:30:49,908

round here, old chap.

546
00:30:49,941 --> 00:30:51,576

Gran, it's everything
I ever dreamed of.

710
00:41:03,655 --> 00:41:05,657
It's ambitious...
I'll give you that...

711
00:41:05,691 --> 00:41:08,093
But I'm not sure this
vintage fabric will behave.

712
00:41:08,126 --> 00:41:10,329
I think it's gonna be tricky
to work with.

713
00:41:10,362 --> 00:41:11,663
Oh.

714
00:41:11,697 --> 00:41:13,632
I know this is exactly
what it needs.

715
00:41:13,665 --> 00:41:16,268
It needs something radiant
but not too structured.

716
00:41:16,301 --> 00:41:18,370
Okay. Go on.

717
00:41:18,403 --> 00:41:20,038
Well...

718
00:41:20,672 --> 00:41:23,642
It needs to flow.

719
00:41:23,675 --> 00:41:25,177
I like how it drapes on her arms

720
00:41:25,210 --> 00:41:26,578
- and gathers at her sides.
- Her?

721
00:41:26,612 --> 00:41:29,414
So, you imagine the wearer
when you're designing?

722
00:41:29,448 --> 00:41:33,519
When I see someone in it,
when-when I imagine it,

723
00:41:33,552 --> 00:41:35,254
sh-she's wearing the dress.

724
00:41:35,287 --> 00:41:37,289
The dress isn't wearing her.

725
00:41:37,322 --> 00:41:39,791
I hope you were all
listening to that.

726
00:41:39,825 --> 00:41:42,261
Something about the '60s?

727
00:41:42,294 --> 00:41:43,762
It's excellent, Ellie.

728
00:41:43,795 --> 00:41:46,131
- And I like your hair.
- Thanks.

729
00:41:49,568 --> 00:41:51,603
Wow.

730
00:41:52,571 --> 00:41:55,507
Yeah, it really suits you.

731
00:41:55,541 --> 00:41:56,808
Yeah, it does, doesn't it?

732
00:41:56,842 --> 00:41:59,111
Everything was
so well made back then.

733
00:41:59,144 --> 00:42:02,147
We have a biba dress
in the back.

734
00:42:02,180 --> 00:42:04,783
1967, immaculate condition.

735
00:42:04,816 --> 00:42:06,485
You should try that one, too.

736
00:42:06,518 --> 00:42:07,686

Uh, yes. Sorry.

- Sorry, it's Irish only.
- Oh.

750
00:42:58,670 --> 00:43:01,740
Only joking.
Speak to Carol down the stairs.

751
00:43:03,408 --> 00:43:04,910
You'd think I'd have more sense

752
00:43:04,943 --> 00:43:06,578
than to take a racing tip
from that fella

753
00:43:06,612 --> 00:43:09,147
after all these years, wouldn't you?

754
00:43:09,781 --> 00:43:11,550
What can I get you, love?

755
00:43:11,583 --> 00:43:13,719
Well, I was hoping a job.

756
00:43:14,686 --> 00:43:16,588
Take a seat. You want a drink?

757
00:43:16,622 --> 00:43:18,223
Uh, yeah.

758
00:43:18,256 --> 00:43:19,625
Could I get a vesper?

759
00:43:19,658 --> 00:43:21,326
This isn't Mayfair, darling.

760
00:43:21,360 --> 00:43:23,562
Have you ever even worked
in a pub before?

761
00:43:23,595 --> 00:43:25,163
No.

762
00:43:25,197 --> 00:43:26,698
But we all have to
start somewhere.

763
00:43:26,732 --> 00:43:29,735
I'll get you a g and t so.

764
00:43:45,951 --> 00:43:49,254
So, what shifts can you do?

765
00:43:49,287 --> 00:43:51,390
Whenever you want.

766
00:43:54,559 --> 00:43:55,961
Excuse me.

767
00:43:55,994 --> 00:43:58,263
Excuse me, love.

768
00:43:58,897 --> 00:44:00,666
I'm talking to you, blondie.

769
00:44:00,699 --> 00:44:02,467
Sorry, I have to be somewhere.

770
00:44:02,501 --> 00:44:04,836
I'm not trying to pick you up,
sweetheart. Don't worry.

771
00:44:04,870 --> 00:44:06,972
I'm not worried.

772
00:44:07,005 --> 00:44:08,674
You look familiar to me.

773
00:44:08,707 --> 00:44:10,275
Who's your mother?

774
00:44:10,308 --> 00:44:11,877
My mother's dead.

775
00:44:11,910 --> 00:44:14,880
I thought she might be.

776
00:44:14,913 --> 00:44:17,182
Most of 'em are.

777
00:44:22,587 --> 00:44:23,822
Get out of the fucking road!

778
00:44:23,855 --> 00:44:25,891
Watch where you're going, girl.

779
00:44:25,924 --> 00:44:28,694
Jesus Christ.

780
00:44:33,565 --> 00:44:35,467
Can I help you?

781
00:44:36,334 --> 00:44:37,669
It's me, Ellie.

782
00:44:38,870 --> 00:44:40,872
So it is.

783
00:44:40,906 --> 00:44:42,441
Look at that.

784
00:44:42,474 --> 00:44:45,310
- You've changed your hair.
- Yeah.

785
00:44:45,343 --> 00:44:46,945
I wanted to go
for something different...

786
00:44:46,978 --> 00:44:48,580
You know, a bit '60s.

787
00:44:48,613 --> 00:44:51,316
You play a lot
of that music, don't you?

788
00:44:51,349 --> 00:44:52,584
Is it too loud?

789
00:44:52,617 --> 00:44:54,853
Not at all,
but what's that about?

790
00:44:54,886 --> 00:44:57,389
It's more my time than yours.

791
00:44:57,422 --> 00:44:58,990
My gran plays it a lot.

792
00:44:59,024 --> 00:45:01,760
Guess I just like the old songs
better than the stuff today.

793
00:45:01,793 --> 00:45:04,629

Colin.

839
00:48:34,773 --> 00:48:37,876
- Mr. Pointer.
- Well, well, well.

840
00:48:37,909 --> 00:48:40,046
Please.

841
00:48:42,614 --> 00:48:46,618
We were promised a great show,
and show you did.

842
00:48:47,519 --> 00:48:49,255
Show you did.

843
00:48:49,288 --> 00:48:50,588
Thank you.

844
00:48:50,622 --> 00:48:53,125
Maybe we could, uh...

845
00:48:53,159 --> 00:48:55,827
Go for some drinks, sandie, eh?

846
00:48:55,860 --> 00:48:56,962
Just us.

847
00:48:58,230 --> 00:49:00,099
I'm with Jack.

848
00:49:00,132 --> 00:49:02,734
Oh, Jack doesn't mind.
Do you, Jack?

849
00:49:05,804 --> 00:49:07,706
Not one bit.

850
00:49:10,276 --> 00:49:11,509
Sandie.

851
00:49:11,543 --> 00:49:12,610
Sorry, sir.

852
00:49:12,644 --> 00:49:15,081
Sandie, get back here. Sandie.

853
00:49:15,114 --> 00:49:17,716
- Jack, I don't want to do this.
- You told me you were serious

854
00:49:17,749 --> 00:49:19,827
about being a performer, so if
you want to keep doing it,

855
00:49:19,851 --> 00:49:21,996
then these are the kind of men
that you need to keep happy.

856
00:49:22,020 --> 00:49:24,589
- The men you really need to perform for.
- No, Jack.

857
00:49:24,622 --> 00:49:27,559
Everybody else is doing it.
What makes you so special?

858
00:49:28,160 --> 00:49:30,628
- Oi!
- She said no!

859
00:49:31,629 --> 00:49:33,865
We all have to start somewhere.

860
00:49:33,898 --> 00:49:37,802
Sandie, don't be a damn fool!

861
00:49:40,306 --> 00:49:42,674
Sandie!

862
00:49:45,577 --> 00:49:47,779
Listen, love, come here!

863
00:49:47,812 --> 00:49:50,682
No, it's not what I thought.

864
00:49:50,715 --> 00:49:53,952
Sandie,
this is the way it works.

865
00:49:54,953 --> 00:49:58,023
I'd do what
your manager tells you.

866
00:49:59,824 --> 00:50:02,660
Don't want to make me
unhappy, do you?

867
00:50:02,694 --> 00:50:04,829
- Eh?
- Wake up.

868
00:50:04,863 --> 00:50:07,099
You were the one
who wanted this!

869
00:50:07,133 --> 00:50:09,934
More than anything, you said.

870
00:50:11,669 --> 00:50:14,340
You know this is all an act.

871
00:50:14,373 --> 00:50:17,709
You know where
this is heading, sandie.

872
00:50:17,742 --> 00:50:20,312
Where are you gonna run to, eh?

873
00:50:20,346 --> 00:50:22,547
Home?

874
00:50:53,945 --> 00:50:55,814
<i>This is just a taste</i>

875
00:50:55,847 --> 00:50:58,217
<i>of things to come, sandie.</i>

876
00:51:14,066 --> 00:51:16,368
Coo-ee.

877
00:51:16,402 --> 00:51:19,003
I know you're not asleep.

878
00:51:19,038 --> 00:51:21,107
Leave her alone!

879
00:51:32,750 --> 00:51:34,752
You know you're not asleep.

880
00:51:55,374 --> 00:51:57,909
<i>You were the one
who wanted this!</i>

881
00:51:59,744 --> 00:52:01,713
<i>More than anything, you said.</i>

882
00:52:01,746 --> 00:52:03,781
<i>What makes you so special?</i>

883
00:52:03,815 --> 00:52:05,917
<i>What makes you so special?</i>

884
00:52:05,950 --> 00:52:07,819
<i>What makes you so special?</i>

885
00:52:10,322 --> 00:52:12,424
- Ellie.
- Oh, my god.

886
00:52:12,458 --> 00:52:14,326
Ellie.
Hey, what-what are you doing?

887
00:52:14,360 --> 00:52:16,462
- What are you doing?
- Starting again.

888
00:52:16,495 --> 00:52:19,864
Listen. This is a wobble, okay?

889
00:52:20,732 --> 00:52:22,134
It's just a crisis
of confidence,

890
00:52:22,168 --> 00:52:25,037
and I see it all the time.

891
00:52:25,070 --> 00:52:29,041
But you are really
onto something here,

892
00:52:29,074 --> 00:52:30,909
so don't stop now.

893
00:52:30,942 --> 00:52:32,111
Okay?

894
00:52:45,090 --> 00:52:47,926
Tuned to the moon?

895
00:52:47,959 --> 00:52:49,994
Customer.

896
00:52:56,768 --> 00:52:58,270
- Hi.
- Hey.

897
00:52:58,304 --> 00:52:59,737
What do you want?

898
00:52:59,771 --> 00:53:02,508
Well, I heard you work here now,

899
00:53:02,541 --> 00:53:04,943
and I was going for a drink,
so I thought,

900
00:53:04,976 --> 00:53:06,844
kill two birds with one stone.

901
00:53:06,878 --> 00:53:10,782
Just because you seemed
a little upset in class today.

902
00:53:10,815 --> 00:53:13,519
And I thought maybe
I could swing by,

903
00:53:13,552 --> 00:53:15,387
see how you were getting on.

904
00:53:15,421 --> 00:53:17,456
Thanks.

905
00:53:17,489 --> 00:53:19,757
I meant,
what do you want to drink?

906
00:53:19,791 --> 00:53:21,493
Oh, yeah.

907
00:53:21,527 --> 00:53:24,129
- Three kronenbourgs, please.
- Sure.

908
00:53:25,930 --> 00:53:27,366
Heard you got a new place.

909
00:53:27,399 --> 00:53:29,535
Yeah. I'm in a bedsit.

910
00:53:29,568 --> 00:53:31,803
That's good, right?

911
00:53:31,836 --> 00:53:33,505
It's really something else.

912
00:53:33,539 --> 00:53:36,874
It must be great
living on your own.

913
00:53:37,509 --> 00:53:39,144
Must be.

914
00:53:39,178 --> 00:53:41,480
Why? What's up?

915
00:53:41,513 --> 00:53:43,148
Nothing.

916
00:53:43,182 --> 00:53:45,451
I'm just a bit overwhelmed
at the moment.

917
00:53:45,484 --> 00:53:47,319
London can be a lot.

918
00:53:50,021 --> 00:53:51,257
I get it.

919
00:53:51,290 --> 00:53:54,493
Coming to the city can be
a bit of a nightmare.

920
00:53:54,526 --> 00:53:56,528
Honestly, I'd be lying if I said

921
00:53:56,562 --> 00:53:59,365
I had the best time
in north London so far.

922
00:53:59,398 --> 00:54:01,333
Where'd you move from?

923
00:54:01,367 --> 00:54:03,168
South London.

924
00:54:04,836 --> 00:54:06,838
I'm gonna get these to my mates.

925
00:54:08,540 --> 00:54:10,209
But...

926
00:54:11,343 --> 00:54:14,912
I know what it's like
to feel like you don't belong.

927
00:54:16,014 --> 00:54:19,951
And I'm a good listener,
if you ever want to talk.

928
00:54:26,458 --> 00:54:29,861
They're meant to talk to you
about their problems,

929
00:54:29,894 --> 00:54:32,930
- not the other way round.
- Mm.

930
00:54:42,341 --> 00:54:45,144
So, how is everything?

931
00:54:45,177 --> 00:54:47,046
You never tell me
anything anymore.

932
00:54:47,079 --> 00:54:49,114
Everything's great, gran.

933
00:54:49,148 --> 00:54:50,616
Goodbye, beautiful.

934
00:54:50,649 --> 00:54:52,318
I'll see you tomorrow.

935
00:54:52,351 --> 00:54:53,619
Who was that?

936
00:54:53,652 --> 00:54:55,087
Uh, no one.

937
00:54:55,120 --> 00:54:57,323
Look, we're at the pub,

938
00:54:57,356 --> 00:54:59,191
a whole bunch of us, having fun.

939
00:54:59,224 --> 00:55:00,459
We?

940
00:55:00,492 --> 00:55:02,061
Yeah, hurricane jocasta.

941
00:55:02,094 --> 00:55:04,029
Everyone, really.
The whole class.

942
00:55:04,063 --> 00:55:06,498
- Something's wrong.
- No.

943
00:55:06,532 --> 00:55:10,035
Ellie, I can hear it
in your voice.

944
00:55:10,069 --> 00:55:12,870
Gran, I really am at the pub.

945
00:55:12,904 --> 00:55:14,573
I'm working here.

946
00:55:14,606 --> 00:55:17,509
Working there? Why?

947
00:55:17,543 --> 00:55:20,145
- I moved out the halls.
- Oh, no. What...

948
00:55:20,179 --> 00:55:22,081
I needed to get
a place of my own.

949
00:55:22,114 --> 00:55:23,881
Did-did something happen?

950
00:55:23,915 --> 00:55:25,917
- Did you see her again?
- No.

951
00:55:25,950 --> 00:55:28,320
No, mum's not here with me.

952
00:55:28,354 --> 00:55:30,322
Then what is it?

953
00:55:30,356 --> 00:55:32,191
What's wrong?

954
00:55:32,224 --> 00:55:33,392
Please tell me.

955
00:55:33,425 --> 00:55:35,026
Look, I should go back in.

956
00:55:35,060 --> 00:55:37,029
I know you think you have
something to prove,

957
00:55:37,062 --> 00:55:40,265
but it's okay to ask for help.

958
00:55:40,299 --> 00:55:42,468
She didn't.

959
00:55:42,501 --> 00:55:45,104
Gran, I have to go.

960
00:55:45,137 --> 00:55:48,140
- I love you.
- Love you, too.

961
00:55:48,173 --> 00:55:51,110
Everything all right, Ellie?

962
00:55:51,143 --> 00:55:53,379
Or do I call you Eloise,

963
00:55:53,412 --> 00:55:56,048
like the old song?

964
00:55:56,081 --> 00:55:58,117
I don't know that song.

965
00:55:58,150 --> 00:55:59,651
And how do you know my name?

966
00:55:59,685 --> 00:56:01,919
I make it my business to know

967
00:56:01,953 --> 00:56:04,323
all the pretty girls
around here.

968
00:56:04,356 --> 00:56:06,625
All their problems.

969
00:56:06,658 --> 00:56:08,427
Always have done.

970
00:56:09,428 --> 00:56:11,163
You smoke, don't you, love?

971
00:56:11,196 --> 00:56:12,131
No.

972
00:56:12,164 --> 00:56:16,235
Oh, must be thinking
of some other blonde.

973
00:56:17,336 --> 00:56:19,438
Anyway...

974
00:56:21,206 --> 00:56:22,974
Be well.

975
00:56:30,716 --> 00:56:33,285
Was handsy bothering you?

976
00:56:33,318 --> 00:56:34,686
Handsy?

977
00:56:34,720 --> 00:56:36,388
Yeah.

978
00:56:36,422 --> 00:56:38,022
The man's like an octopus.

979
00:56:38,056 --> 00:56:40,192
Carol says he was a right
ladies' man back in the day.

980
00:56:40,225 --> 00:56:43,328
Probably thinks
he has a shot with you.

981
00:56:46,231 --> 00:56:48,200
<i>Do you believe in spirits?</i>

982
00:56:48,233 --> 00:56:51,036
What kind of a question is that?

983
00:56:51,069 --> 00:56:53,338
That brown stuff
pays your wages.

984
00:56:54,406 --> 00:56:56,575
I mean...

985
00:56:56,608 --> 00:56:58,744
Do you believe in ghosts?

986
00:56:58,777 --> 00:57:01,480
Ghosts? No.

987
00:57:01,513 --> 00:57:03,282
Why?

988
00:57:04,483 --> 00:57:06,318
Are you scared down here?

989
00:57:06,351 --> 00:57:09,721
If this place is haunted by
anything, it's the good times.

990
00:57:09,755 --> 00:57:14,526
When it's empty,
all I hear is the laughs.

991
00:57:14,560 --> 00:57:17,229
Every gangster, every copper,

992
00:57:17,262 --> 00:57:19,398
every red-faced lush
has been in here,

993
00:57:19,431 --> 00:57:24,036
and all those high spirits
have soaked into the walls.

994
00:57:24,069 --> 00:57:26,371
You could probably
get drunk on just that.

995
00:57:27,773 --> 00:57:30,042
Yeah.

996
00:57:34,246 --> 00:57:37,014
Ellie, I love you, girl.

997
00:57:37,049 --> 00:57:39,218
You fit right in.

998
00:57:39,251 --> 00:57:42,321
But you can't sleep here.

999
00:58:25,697 --> 00:58:27,466
Come on,
they're waiting for you!

1000
00:58:28,300 --> 00:58:30,402
- Hey!
- Don't touch me!

1001
00:58:30,435 --> 00:58:32,771
Oh, shut up, will you?

1002
00:58:32,804 --> 00:58:35,307

1052
01:01:01,853 --> 01:01:03,522
So, what is it?

1053
01:01:03,555 --> 01:01:05,691
Sandie.

1054
01:01:08,994 --> 01:01:11,329
You're too good
for this, sandie.

1055
01:01:12,464 --> 01:01:15,367
Pretty little thing like you,
laying in the gutter.

1056
01:01:15,400 --> 01:01:18,270
I'd get out while you can, girl.

1057
01:01:18,303 --> 01:01:19,705
You're better than this.

1058
01:01:19,738 --> 01:01:21,673
I don't think I am.

1059
01:01:21,707 --> 01:01:23,275
Course you are.

1060
01:01:23,308 --> 01:01:25,477
Just look in the mirror.

1061
01:01:26,278 --> 01:01:27,512
What if I don't want to?

1062
01:01:27,546 --> 01:01:30,716
Then maybe
it's too late for you.

1063
01:01:36,021 --> 01:01:37,622
No...

1064
01:01:41,760 --> 01:01:43,295
Sandie.

1065
01:01:43,328 --> 01:01:44,996
Sandie, look at me.
Look at me, sandie.

1066

Got any plans tonight, Ellie?

1088
01:04:30,595 --> 01:04:33,565
Uh, yeah, I'd love to come out.

1089
01:04:34,499 --> 01:04:36,735
I haven't even said
what it is yet.

1090
01:04:37,802 --> 01:04:39,071
Right.

1091
01:04:39,105 --> 01:04:41,473
But you're saying yes anyway?

1092
01:04:41,506 --> 01:04:44,643
Yeah, I need to get out
of the house.

1093
01:04:44,676 --> 01:04:45,744
Oh.

1094
01:04:45,777 --> 01:04:48,080
Well, there's
a student union night.

1095
01:04:48,114 --> 01:04:50,649
A Halloween thing.

1096
01:04:50,682 --> 01:04:52,851
Don't we have to dress up?

1097
01:04:52,884 --> 01:04:54,653
I was gonna go like this.

1098
01:04:54,686 --> 01:04:57,923
And you're already in black,
so it's perfect.

1099
01:04:57,956 --> 01:04:59,524
Will that be enough?

1100
01:04:59,557 --> 01:05:01,893
Well, I was gonna slap
a bit of this on.

1101
01:05:02,994 --> 01:05:05,730

Is there anything I can do?

1154

Okay.

1162
01:08:57,196 --> 01:08:59,431
So you'll have to be quiet.

1163
01:08:59,465 --> 01:09:01,766
Oh.

Okay.

01:09:03,902 --> 01:09:06,771
You don't just want
to go to sleep?

1166
01:09:06,804 --> 01:09:10,075
No, I really don't
want to go to sleep.

1167
01:09:10,109 --> 01:09:14,146
Well, I can keep you up.

01:10:49,841 --> 01:10:51,176
Are you okay?

1174
01:10:52,044 --> 01:10:53,878
Get off her.

1175
01:10:56,382 --> 01:10:58,016
Get off her.

1176
01:10:58,850 --> 01:11:00,052
What's wrong?

1177
01:11:02,254 --> 01:11:03,555
Get off her! Get off her!

1178
01:11:03,589 --> 01:11:05,457
I'm not... I'm not on her.

1179
01:11:05,491 --> 01:11:07,859
Who would even want you?

1180
01:11:07,892 --> 01:11:09,027
You belong to me!

1181
01:11:11,630 --> 01:11:13,931
I own you!

1182
01:11:13,965 --> 01:11:16,934
Don't you ever disobey me.

1183
01:11:19,471 --> 01:11:21,206
Ellie.

1184
01:11:24,008 --> 01:11:27,446
I'm the one who'll pay, not you.

1185
01:11:29,648 --> 01:11:31,083
Ellie, what's wrong?

1186
01:11:31,116 --> 01:11:32,917
Who'd have you now, eh?

1187
01:11:32,950 --> 01:11:35,953
Eloise!
What is going on in there?

1188
01:11:35,987 --> 01:11:38,190
No male visitors!

1189
01:11:38,223 --> 01:11:39,625
Who's in there?!

1190
01:11:41,360 --> 01:11:43,462
I'll call the police!

1191
01:11:43,495 --> 01:11:44,962
Fuck.

1192
01:11:44,996 --> 01:11:46,532
Get him out of here!

1193
01:11:46,565 --> 01:11:50,035
Where are you gonna go, eh?

1194
01:11:50,968 --> 01:11:52,604
Where you going?
Where you going?

1195
01:11:52,638 --> 01:11:55,040

01:12:09,555 --> 01:12:10,622
Get out!

1198
01:12:15,361 --> 01:12:18,330
Get out!

1199
01:12:18,364 --> 01:12:20,632

01:12:49,495 --> 01:12:51,896
Are you okay?

1203
01:12:53,399 --> 01:12:55,267
Yeah.

1204
01:12:55,300 --> 01:12:57,202
Did he hurt you?

1205
01:12:58,303 --> 01:13:00,305
- No.
- You sure?

1206
01:13:01,306 --> 01:13:03,075
He didn't hurt me.

1207
01:13:05,009 --> 01:13:08,080
We'll talk about this
in the morning.

1208
01:13:38,510 --> 01:13:40,179
Sorry.

1209
01:13:40,779 --> 01:13:42,314
For everything.

1210
01:13:42,347 --> 01:13:43,715
It won't happen again, will it?

1211
01:13:43,749 --> 01:13:45,317
No.

1212
01:13:45,350 --> 01:13:48,654
I-I'll-I'll pay
for the mirror, too.

1213
01:13:48,687 --> 01:13:51,323
We all pay
for a broken mirror, deary.

1214
01:13:51,356 --> 01:13:52,491
Ms. Collins.

1215
01:13:54,025 --> 01:13:56,728
Did a girl live upstairs before?

1216
01:13:56,762 --> 01:13:59,698
Lots of girls have lived here
over the years.

1217
01:13:59,731 --> 01:14:02,234
Someone called sandie?

1218
01:14:03,268 --> 01:14:05,237
Lots of girls have lived here
over the years,

1219
01:14:05,270 --> 01:14:07,539
and not all of them
with their real names.

1220
01:14:07,573 --> 01:14:09,006
Why do you ask?

1221
01:14:09,041 --> 01:14:11,410
Did someone die in my room?

1222
01:14:12,544 --> 01:14:14,213
This is London.

1223
01:14:14,246 --> 01:14:16,315
Someone's died in every room

1224
01:14:16,348 --> 01:14:19,051
in every building
in this whole city.

1225
01:14:19,084 --> 01:14:21,487
Every street corner, too.

1226
01:14:21,520 --> 01:14:23,589
Oh, and speaking of which,
I would have killed

1227
01:14:23,622 --> 01:14:26,758
your gentleman friend
last night if I'd caught him,

1228
01:14:26,792 --> 01:14:30,229
so count yourself lucky,
broken mirror or not.

1229

01:17:31,576 --> 01:17:33,345
<i>You look familiar to me.</i>

1277
01:17:33,378 --> 01:17:35,647
<i>Did he hurt you?</i>

1278
01:17:38,650 --> 01:17:41,253
Just so I've got this straight,

1279
01:17:41,286 --> 01:17:43,655
you-you witnessed
the murder last night,

1280
01:17:43,689 --> 01:17:47,559
but you believe this was
a vision from the past,

1281
01:17:47,592 --> 01:17:52,464
the murder of a young woman
in the mid to late 1960s

1282
01:17:52,497 --> 01:17:55,767
by a man you believe
to be her pimp.

1283
01:17:56,802 --> 01:17:57,936
Yeah.

1284
01:17:57,969 --> 01:17:59,905
You're an art student, correct?

1285
01:17:59,938 --> 01:18:01,506
Uh, fashion.

1286
01:18:01,540 --> 01:18:04,242
Have you ever taken
any hallucinogens?

1287
01:18:04,276 --> 01:18:06,244
Acid, mushrooms, mescaline?

1288
01:18:06,278 --> 01:18:08,313
We're not gonna get you
into trouble if you have.

1289
01:18:08,346 --> 01:18:10,949
Yeah, I know it sounds crazy,
but I'm not on drugs.

1290
01:18:10,982 --> 01:18:12,451
I don't take anything.

1291
01:18:12,484 --> 01:18:14,419
You were at a party before.

1292
01:18:14,453 --> 01:18:15,997
Could somebody have
slipped you something?

1293
01:18:16,021 --> 01:18:18,390
Maybe somebody
bought you a drink?

1294
01:18:18,423 --> 01:18:19,758
Get these down you.

1295
01:18:19,791 --> 01:18:22,327
Uh, no.

1296
01:18:22,360 --> 01:18:25,330
No, it-it... it started
before last night.

1297
01:18:25,363 --> 01:18:28,266
When I was sober,
I saw landmarks in my dreams,

1298
01:18:28,300 --> 01:18:30,368
details of nightclubs,

1299
01:18:30,402 --> 01:18:31,813
<i>places that
I'd never been to before,</i>

1300
01:18:31,837 --> 01:18:35,407
<i>and then I saw those details
in real life.</i>

1301
01:18:35,440 --> 01:18:39,911
I know something bad happened
to this girl,

1302
01:18:39,945 --> 01:18:44,916
'cause I have these visions,
these visions of the past.

1303
01:18:44,950 --> 01:18:48,487
Ever since I moved to London,
I keep seeing sandie.

1304
01:18:48,520 --> 01:18:50,922
Th-that's the murdered girl.

1305
01:18:50,956 --> 01:18:53,759
Have you only been here
a short time?

1306
01:18:53,792 --> 01:18:55,427
A few weeks.

1307
01:18:55,460 --> 01:18:57,496
London, well, it can be a lot.

1308
01:18:57,529 --> 01:18:59,898
Maybe it would help
if you spoke to someone.

1309
01:18:59,931 --> 01:19:02,034
Look, please just listen to me!

1310
01:19:02,068 --> 01:19:05,570
Is there a history
of s-schizophrenia

1311
01:19:05,604 --> 01:19:08,540
or mental health issues
in your family?

1312
01:19:11,443 --> 01:19:14,046
I know who the killer is.

1313
01:19:14,080 --> 01:19:17,482
It's her boyfriend,
uh, and her pimp, Jack.

1314
01:19:17,516 --> 01:19:19,551
I've seen him
in the present day.

1315
01:19:20,552 --> 01:19:23,055
Look, there's this man
I've seen around soho

1316
01:19:23,089 --> 01:19:24,456
<i>who follows me.</i>

1317
01:19:24,489 --> 01:19:25,791
<i>The first time I saw him</i>

1318
01:19:25,824 --> 01:19:27,692
<i>outside one of
those models places,</i>

1319
01:19:27,726 --> 01:19:29,528
<i>he didn't take
much notice of me,</i>

1320
01:19:29,561 --> 01:19:31,563
<i>but he did suddenly take notice</i>

1321
01:19:31,596 --> 01:19:33,431
<i>when I changed my hair
to the same style</i>

1322
01:19:33,465 --> 01:19:35,400
<i>as sandie's, the murdered girl.</i>

1323
01:19:35,433 --> 01:19:37,836
What, this hairdo?

1324
01:19:38,770 --> 01:19:41,773
Look... look, my point is
I've seen Jack.

1325
01:19:41,807 --> 01:19:45,410
I've seen the killer
as an old man around soho.

1326
01:19:45,443 --> 01:19:48,613
Can you narrow down
"around soho"?

1327
01:19:49,447 --> 01:19:51,349
He drinks at the toucan.

1328
01:19:51,383 --> 01:19:54,553
I think we've got all we need.

1329
01:20:18,009 --> 01:20:19,845
And then she says the...

1330
01:20:19,878 --> 01:20:21,789
The killer drinks at the toucan
and-and narrows it down

1331
01:20:21,813 --> 01:20:23,815
to me, you
and the whole rest of soho.

1332
01:20:25,151 --> 01:20:26,985
Yeah,
I'm sitting there thinking,

1333
01:20:27,018 --> 01:20:29,621
"this is complete bullshit,
darling."

1334
01:20:29,654 --> 01:20:30,956
Miss Turner.

1335
01:20:30,989 --> 01:20:32,158
Miss Turner, don't go.

1336
01:20:32,191 --> 01:20:33,792
I'd really like you
to stick around.

1337
01:20:33,825 --> 01:20:36,128
What do I need to do
to convince you I'm not crazy?

1338
01:20:36,162 --> 01:20:37,762
I don't think you are.

1339
01:20:37,796 --> 01:20:39,107
I just think you need
a bit of help to settle in.

1340
01:20:39,131 --> 01:20:41,100
A-A support system.

1341
01:20:41,133 --> 01:20:42,534
You've done the right thing.

1342
01:20:42,567 --> 01:20:44,002
Please hear that, okay?

1343
01:20:44,036 --> 01:20:45,503
And I will look into
sandie's murder,

1344
01:20:45,537 --> 01:20:47,039
and I've got
your contact details,

1345
01:20:47,073 --> 01:20:49,374
so if anything comes up,
I'll be in touch.

1346
01:20:50,209 --> 01:20:51,610
Thank you.

1347
01:20:51,643 --> 01:20:53,411
Though I will say,
in such cases,

1348
01:20:53,445 --> 01:20:55,547
especially this old,
it's hard when you don't have

1349
01:20:55,580 --> 01:20:57,149
something concrete to go on...

1350
01:20:57,183 --> 01:20:59,651
Even a last name.

1351
01:21:08,060 --> 01:21:11,596
I want to look up murdered
women, uh, missing persons

1352
01:21:11,630 --> 01:21:15,034
in the central London area
from 1960 to 1969.

1353
01:21:15,067 --> 01:21:17,535
Aren't you a fashion student?

1354
01:21:18,137 --> 01:21:20,472
Yeah. Yeah, it's research.

1355
01:21:20,505 --> 01:21:22,507
You're doing some
cool fashion shoots

1356
01:21:22,540 --> 01:21:24,709
based on infamous murder sites
or something?

1357
01:21:24,743 --> 01:21:25,610
Yeah.

1358
01:21:25,644 --> 01:21:27,812
Yeah, that's exactly right.

1359
01:21:27,846 --> 01:21:30,815
- Killer.
- It is.

1360
01:21:48,267 --> 01:21:50,036
Hey, Ellie, I got your...

1361
01:21:50,069 --> 01:21:51,937
Jesus, John!

1362
01:21:51,970 --> 01:21:53,805
Why whisper like that?

1363
01:21:53,838 --> 01:21:55,740
It's a library.

1364
01:21:56,708 --> 01:21:58,210
Right.

1365
01:21:58,244 --> 01:22:00,079
I have your stuff.

1366
01:22:00,112 --> 01:22:01,713
You ran out.

1367
01:22:02,580 --> 01:22:04,015
Uh, left your bag.

1368
01:22:04,050 --> 01:22:06,085
Everyone's here,

1369
01:22:06,118 --> 01:22:07,686
cramming for the test.

1370
01:22:07,719 --> 01:22:10,822
Listen, about last night.

1371
01:22:10,855 --> 01:22:13,225
I mean, if I did
something wrong...

1372
01:22:13,259 --> 01:22:14,960
No, you didn't.

1373
01:22:14,993 --> 01:22:16,528
Sorry, it's not about you.

1374
01:22:16,561 --> 01:22:19,864
Then... what is it, El?

1375
01:22:21,300 --> 01:22:24,602
You'll think I sound crazy.

1376
01:22:27,872 --> 01:22:29,507
Talk to me.

1377
01:22:29,541 --> 01:22:32,677
Last night, I saw something.

1378
01:22:32,711 --> 01:22:35,114
In the bedroom, from the past.

1379
01:22:35,147 --> 01:22:36,915
What did you see?

1380
01:22:39,617 --> 01:22:41,853
A girl was stabbed.

1381
01:22:42,887 --> 01:22:44,923
There's a girl
that used to live in my room...

1382
01:22:44,956 --> 01:22:46,524
<i>Sandie.</i>

1383
01:22:46,558 --> 01:22:48,236
<i>The guy that killed her
is still out there.</i>

1384
01:22:48,260 --> 01:22:50,628
So I'm looking
for murdered women

1385
01:22:50,662 --> 01:22:52,630
and missing persons
from the '60s

1386
01:22:52,664 --> 01:22:55,034
to try and find out her name.

1387
01:22:56,035 --> 01:22:58,636
And if I don't,
I'm gonna lose my mind.

1388
01:22:58,670 --> 01:23:01,539
Maybe I already have.

1389
01:23:02,174 --> 01:23:04,043
Feel free to run a mile now.

1390
01:23:04,076 --> 01:23:06,312
Listen.

1391
01:23:06,345 --> 01:23:11,716
My auntie believes in
all sorts of weird shit.

1392
01:23:11,750 --> 01:23:15,587
So you just tell me
how I can help.

1393
01:23:18,923 --> 01:23:21,960
Well, I guess you can start
with the next year of boxes:

1394
01:23:21,993 --> 01:23:24,263
1966.

1395
01:23:24,296 --> 01:23:26,798
Damn. This is just one year?

1396
01:23:27,599 --> 01:23:30,069
London's a bad place.

1397
01:23:35,006 --> 01:23:38,877
Library
will be closing in 15 minutes.

1398
01:24:13,112 --> 01:24:15,013
That was quick.

1399
01:24:50,014 --> 01:24:51,783
Fuck this!

1400
01:25:00,959 --> 01:25:02,894
Did you see that?

1401
01:25:02,927 --> 01:25:05,897
Ashley, she could have
fucking killed her.

1402
01:25:05,930 --> 01:25:07,632
It's okay.

1403
01:25:08,234 --> 01:25:09,268
It's okay.

1404
01:25:09,301 --> 01:25:11,137
It's not fucking okay.

1405
01:25:11,170 --> 01:25:12,971
What the actual fuck?!

1406
01:25:13,004 --> 01:25:14,373
Security!

1407
01:25:14,406 --> 01:25:15,874
Stay here.

1408
01:25:15,907 --> 01:25:18,144
Jocasta! Jocasta, wait!

1409
01:25:18,177 --> 01:25:19,677
Security!

1410
01:25:19,711 --> 01:25:20,879
Stop!

1411
01:25:20,912 --> 01:25:22,747
Jocasta, it was an accident.

1412
01:25:22,780 --> 01:25:24,416
An accident?
Are you fucking kidding me?

1413
01:25:24,450 --> 01:25:26,085
Security!

1414
01:25:39,231 --> 01:25:40,932
<i>What happened to me?</i>

1415
01:25:40,965 --> 01:25:44,403
<i>What happened to me?
What happened to me?</i>

1416
01:25:44,436 --> 01:25:45,970

1417
01:25:46,004 --> 01:25:47,805
<i>What happened to me?
What happened to me?</i>

1418
01:25:47,839 --> 01:25:49,841
<i>What happened to me?</i>

1419
01:25:49,874 --> 01:25:51,277
<i>What happened to me?</i>

1420
01:25:51,310 --> 01:25:52,911
<i>What happened to me?</i>

1421
01:25:52,944 --> 01:25:54,446

<i>What happened to me?

1431
01:26:16,468 --> 01:26:18,170
<i>What happened to me?</i>

1432
01:26:18,204 --> 01:26:19,771
Oi!

1433
01:26:19,804 --> 01:26:21,839
Where do you think you're going?

1434
01:26:22,874 --> 01:26:24,809
You think you can just
walk away?

1435
01:26:41,126 --> 01:26:44,096
Leave me alone!

1436
01:26:54,406 --> 01:26:57,243
Hey, come back here, you slut!

1437
01:26:57,276 --> 01:27:00,446
Get back here, whore!

1438
01:27:00,479 --> 01:27:03,848
I'm talking to you, sandie!

1439
01:27:03,881 --> 01:27:06,185
Leave me alone!

1440
01:27:23,335 --> 01:27:25,504
Jack?

1441
01:27:27,506 --> 01:27:30,309
Jack! Jack!

1442
01:27:31,577 --> 01:27:34,046
Jack!

1443
01:27:35,047 --> 01:27:36,814
Jack!

1444
01:27:51,130 --> 01:27:52,930
Where the hell have you been?

1445
01:27:52,964 --> 01:27:54,433
I've been covering you
downstairs

1446
01:27:54,466 --> 01:27:56,901
for the last hour,
for fuck's sake.

1447
01:27:56,934 --> 01:27:59,937
Ellie, get down
in that basement, girl.

1448
01:27:59,971 --> 01:28:02,274

You know your siren song
is playing?

1463
01:28:47,553 --> 01:28:50,489
I just put this on the jukebox,

1464
01:28:50,522 --> 01:28:53,092
and lo and behold, you appear.

1465
01:28:53,125 --> 01:28:55,094
Carol was worried about you.

1466
01:28:55,127 --> 01:28:56,628
Thought you'd gone missing.

1467
01:28:56,662 --> 01:28:59,997
I told her no one ever
really disappears.

1468
01:29:00,032 --> 01:29:04,001
They're always around somewhere.

1469
01:29:04,670 --> 01:29:06,971
- I'm right here.
- Aren't you just?

1470
01:29:07,004 --> 01:29:10,075
I'll have a pint
of numbers, love.

1471
01:29:13,445 --> 01:29:16,281
- I hear you were quite the ladies' man.
- Were?

1472
01:29:17,282 --> 01:29:18,517
How dare you?

1473
01:29:18,550 --> 01:29:20,252
Still am.

1474
01:29:20,285 --> 01:29:21,653
You never lose it.

1475
01:29:21,687 --> 01:29:23,655
You knew a lot
of the girls round here?

1476
01:29:23,689 --> 01:29:25,257
A lot of 'em?

1477
01:29:26,058 --> 01:29:27,659
I knew all of 'em.

1478
01:29:27,693 --> 01:29:29,228
Sandie?

1479
01:29:30,429 --> 01:29:32,464

1485
01:29:58,657 --> 01:30:00,426
No.

1486
01:30:00,459 --> 01:30:02,026
I knew all the girls.

1487
01:30:02,060 --> 01:30:04,962
Like to think
I looked after 'em.

1488
01:30:04,996 --> 01:30:07,433
Had to keep them
in order, too, mind.

1489
01:30:07,466 --> 01:30:09,568
Keep 'em in line.

1490
01:30:09,601 --> 01:30:12,970
Sandie, she was special, though.

1491
01:30:13,004 --> 01:30:14,972
She didn't belong.

1492
01:30:15,006 --> 01:30:17,543
I thought she was
too good for it.

1493
01:30:18,477 --> 01:30:21,180
But, you know,
at the end of the day,

1494
01:30:21,213 --> 01:30:23,981
you all look the same on a slab.

1495
01:30:26,084 --> 01:30:28,287
I know what you did.

1496
01:30:30,088 --> 01:30:33,525
I've done a lot of things,
Eloise.

1497
01:30:33,559 --> 01:30:36,728
You're gonna have to be
more specific, love.

1498
01:30:36,762 --> 01:30:39,598
I know what you did to sandie.

1499
01:30:39,631 --> 01:30:42,367
- Do you, now?
- Mm.

1500
01:30:42,401 --> 01:30:44,336
Yeah, I saw her.

1501
01:30:44,369 --> 01:30:46,472
I see her.

1502
01:30:46,505 --> 01:30:48,240
I know what happened.

1503
01:30:48,273 --> 01:30:50,642
Well, whatever happened
to sandie,

1504
01:30:50,676 --> 01:30:52,578
she brought it on herself.

1505
01:30:52,611 --> 01:30:55,481
But no one deserves that.

1506
01:30:55,514 --> 01:30:57,149
Listen.

1507
01:30:57,182 --> 01:31:01,053
I know where you live, Eloise.

1508
01:31:01,086 --> 01:31:04,089
And I don't know
what you've seen or heard,

1509
01:31:04,122 --> 01:31:06,625
but I can tell you
sandie ended up

1510
01:31:06,658 --> 01:31:09,026
exactly where she wanted to be.

1511
01:31:09,061 --> 01:31:12,264
Funny you mention her, though,

1512
01:31:12,297 --> 01:31:14,333
because the first thing I did

1513
01:31:14,366 --> 01:31:18,537
when I dragged myself back
to this miserable smoke

1514
01:31:18,570 --> 01:31:22,541
was to look up her old bones.

1515
01:31:22,574 --> 01:31:27,346
But turns out some people
don't want to be found.

1516
01:31:28,747 --> 01:31:30,249
But you killed her.

1517
01:31:30,282 --> 01:31:32,384
You think I killed sandie?

1518
01:31:32,417 --> 01:31:34,553
I know you did!

1519
01:31:34,586 --> 01:31:38,524
Ha! I think you'll find
Alex killed sandie.

1520
01:31:38,557 --> 01:31:40,158
Come back.

1521
01:31:40,192 --> 01:31:43,262
Nah. I've had enough
of this line of questioning.

1522
01:31:43,295 --> 01:31:46,532
You think she was an angel,

1523
01:31:46,565 --> 01:31:48,467
but don't be fooled.

1524
01:31:48,500 --> 01:31:49,768
I'm recording this.

1525
01:31:49,801 --> 01:31:51,303
You won't get away with it!

1526
01:31:51,336 --> 01:31:54,806
So what?
I do what I like in this manor.

1527
01:31:54,840 --> 01:31:56,642
The police know! I told them!

1528
01:31:56,675 --> 01:31:59,545
Like I give a flying fuck.

1529
01:31:59,578 --> 01:32:01,413
Look, wait!

1530
01:32:01,446 --> 01:32:03,148
When you see Alex

1531
01:32:03,181 --> 01:32:05,751
in whatever little hell
she's currently in,

1532
01:32:05,784 --> 01:32:07,419
you tell her I said hello.

1533
01:32:13,792 --> 01:32:15,427
Oh, my good god.

1534
01:32:15,460 --> 01:32:17,162
Jesus.

1535
01:32:18,497 --> 01:32:20,299
- What happened?
- He just stopped

1536
01:32:20,332 --> 01:32:22,601
in-in the middle of the street.

1537
01:32:22,634 --> 01:32:25,137
Oh, Lindsey, you poor bastard.

1538
01:32:25,170 --> 01:32:27,439
Call an ambulance, pet.

1539
01:32:27,472 --> 01:32:28,774
Now!

1540
01:32:28,807 --> 01:32:31,343
And tell 'em
he used to be police.

1541
01:32:31,376 --> 01:32:34,279
- That'll make them hurry.
- Right. Okay.

1542
01:32:34,313 --> 01:32:36,114
Lindsey?

1543
01:32:36,148 --> 01:32:38,383
- He's police?
- Yeah, he's ex-vice.

1544
01:32:38,417 --> 01:32:40,652
He used to be a copper in soho
for years and years,

1545
01:32:40,686 --> 01:32:44,723
working the red light district,
and now look at him.

1546
01:32:44,756 --> 01:32:48,727
Then his name's not Jack?

1547
01:32:48,760 --> 01:32:49,861
Jack?

1548
01:32:49,895 --> 01:32:51,797
No, love.

1549
01:32:51,830 --> 01:32:53,632
That's Lindsey.

1550
01:32:55,467 --> 01:32:57,269
Yeah, he looks very bad.

1551
01:32:57,302 --> 01:32:58,746
I reckon you're a copper
or something.

1552
01:32:58,770 --> 01:33:01,473
<i>I reckon
you're a copper or something.</i>

1553
01:33:01,506 --> 01:33:02,708
Do you, now?

1554
01:33:02,741 --> 01:33:05,410
<i>Do you, now?</i>

1555
01:33:05,444 --> 01:33:08,747
<i>I'd get out while you can, girl.</i>

1556
01:33:08,780 --> 01:33:11,116
Ellie?

1557
01:33:12,618 --> 01:33:14,419
Ellie!

1558
01:33:21,226 --> 01:33:22,761
<i>I've let you down.</i>

1559
01:33:22,794 --> 01:33:24,363
<i>I've let mum down.</i>

1560
01:33:24,396 --> 01:33:26,898
You haven't let anyone down.

1561
01:33:26,932 --> 01:33:29,801
- You never could.
- Okay.

1562
01:33:29,835 --> 01:33:31,937
Ellie, I don't know
what's happened,

1563
01:33:31,970 --> 01:33:35,374
but it's okay to come home.

1564
01:33:35,407 --> 01:33:37,376
You haven't failed anyone.

1565
01:33:38,710 --> 01:33:41,246
I'll-I'll come and get you
first thing tomorrow.

1566
01:33:41,279 --> 01:33:44,249
No, gran, I can't stay
another night.

1567
01:33:44,282 --> 01:33:46,785
Well, uh, I'll get someone
to drive me now.

1568
01:33:46,818 --> 01:33:48,720
Ellie?

1569
01:33:48,754 --> 01:33:50,589
- Ellie?
- Hello?

1570
01:33:51,556 --> 01:33:53,458
Hello?

1571
01:33:53,492 --> 01:33:55,193
Look, I have someone
who can help.

1572
01:33:55,227 --> 01:33:56,395
- El!
- I'll call you.

1573
01:33:56,428 --> 01:33:57,663
Ellie? Eloise?

1574
01:33:57,696 --> 01:33:59,665
- Ellie!
- John!

1575
01:33:59,698 --> 01:34:01,700
John!

1576
01:34:01,733 --> 01:34:03,435
Ellie.

1577
01:34:04,436 --> 01:34:05,337
Thank god.

1578
01:34:05,370 --> 01:34:07,839
I saw the flashing lights,
and I thought...

1579
01:34:07,873 --> 01:34:09,274
I'm scared here.

1580
01:34:09,307 --> 01:34:10,809
I'll take you back to yours.

1581
01:34:10,842 --> 01:34:13,378
No, I want to go home.
Home, home.

1582
01:34:13,412 --> 01:34:15,447
I-I need to get out of London.

1583
01:34:15,480 --> 01:34:17,416
Can you help me get
to the train station?

1584
01:34:17,449 --> 01:34:19,551
Forget the train.
I'll drive you.

1585
01:34:19,584 --> 01:34:21,319
You have a car?

1586
01:34:21,353 --> 01:34:23,288
How else am I supposed to get

1587
01:34:23,321 --> 01:34:25,624
to north London
from south London?

1588
01:34:26,591 --> 01:34:28,527
<i>Right, I'm gonna go in there,</i>

1589
01:34:28,560 --> 01:34:31,697
<i>get my things and never see
that fucking room ever again.</i>

1590
01:34:31,730 --> 01:34:33,699
<i>Do you want me
to come up and help?</i>

1591
01:34:33,732 --> 01:34:35,467
<i>No, better not.
Ms. Collins would probably</i>

1592
01:34:35,500 --> 01:34:37,436
<i>kill you if she sees you again.</i>

1593
01:34:37,469 --> 01:34:41,440
Maybe if I plead, she might
give me some of my deposit.

1594
01:34:41,473 --> 01:34:42,607
Fuck.

1595
01:34:47,746 --> 01:34:51,450
If I'm not back in 15 minutes,
maybe come check on me.

1596
01:34:52,551 --> 01:34:54,486
Okay.

1597
01:35:09,968 --> 01:35:12,437
Ms. Collins, it's me, Ellie.

1598
01:35:12,471 --> 01:35:14,773
Just coming, deary.

1599
01:35:17,743 --> 01:35:20,846
You look like
you've had a fright.

1600
01:35:20,879 --> 01:35:22,848
I need your help.

1601
01:35:23,849 --> 01:35:24,883
Just you, is it?

1602
01:35:24,916 --> 01:35:26,785
Yeah.

1603
01:35:26,818 --> 01:35:28,754
I'll put the kettle on. Come in.

1604
01:35:31,556 --> 01:35:36,762
Your music upstairs got me
breaking out my old records.

1605
01:35:36,795 --> 01:35:40,632
Oh, I picked up
a letter of yours by mistake.

1606
01:35:40,665 --> 01:35:42,400
It's in that pile.

1607
01:35:56,681 --> 01:35:59,085
Don't judge me
on the cigarettes.

1608
01:35:59,118 --> 01:36:02,054
All that hoo-ha last night
got me going again.

1609
01:36:02,088 --> 01:36:03,421
Sorry.

1610
01:36:03,455 --> 01:36:05,390
Oh, it's not your fault.

1611
01:36:05,423 --> 01:36:07,793
I was always on the edge
of starting again.

1612
01:36:07,826 --> 01:36:09,828
So...

1613
01:36:11,863 --> 01:36:13,632
How can I help you?

1614
01:36:13,665 --> 01:36:16,535
Ms. Collins,
i-I'm really sorry to do this.

1615
01:36:16,568 --> 01:36:18,436
I-I didn't want
to be this person,

1616
01:36:18,470 --> 01:36:20,072
but I'm leaving tonight.

1617
01:36:20,106 --> 01:36:21,940
Oh.

1618
01:36:21,973 --> 01:36:23,675
Are you, now?

1619
01:36:23,708 --> 01:36:26,812
I'm not having
a very good time here, and I...

1620
01:36:26,845 --> 01:36:29,481
I really need to go back home,
and I promise...

1621
01:36:29,514 --> 01:36:30,958
I promise I'll pay you
for the mirror,

1622
01:36:30,982 --> 01:36:33,652
- but I really need some of my deposit.
- Slow down.

1623
01:36:33,685 --> 01:36:35,987
I don't want to beg,
but this has been a disaster.

1624
01:36:36,021 --> 01:36:38,690
Hush. Slow down.

1625
01:36:38,723 --> 01:36:40,592
Drink your tea.

1626
01:36:46,698 --> 01:36:50,069
You went to the police,
didn't you?

1627
01:36:50,102 --> 01:36:53,972
About the room upstairs, hmm?

1628
01:36:54,005 --> 01:36:55,607
Yeah.

1629
01:36:57,008 --> 01:37:00,378
A nice police lady came round

1630
01:37:00,412 --> 01:37:03,982
asking questions about you.

1631
01:37:04,015 --> 01:37:07,419
About your well-being.

1632
01:37:07,452 --> 01:37:10,822
Welfare check, she called it.

1633
01:37:10,856 --> 01:37:13,725
Had me worried.

1634
01:37:13,758 --> 01:37:16,962
You'd been saying
a girl died up there.

1635
01:37:18,997 --> 01:37:20,432
- Sorry.
- Oh.

1636
01:37:20,465 --> 01:37:23,135
It's funny 'cause...

1637
01:37:23,169 --> 01:37:26,605
There is some truth in it.

1638
01:37:27,839 --> 01:37:31,743
I hadn't thought about it
until you brought it up, but...

1639
01:37:31,776 --> 01:37:35,847
A girl did die up there,
I suppose.

1640
01:37:35,881 --> 01:37:37,749
The young me...

1641
01:37:38,650 --> 01:37:42,654
That came to this big city.

1642
01:37:44,990 --> 01:37:46,591
Sandie.

1643
01:37:47,726 --> 01:37:50,896
<i>I had hopes and dreams like you.</i>

1644
01:37:50,929 --> 01:37:53,199
I wanted to be a singer.

1645
01:37:53,232 --> 01:37:55,101
I wanted to perform.

1646
01:37:55,134 --> 01:37:56,902
To act.

1647
01:37:56,935 --> 01:38:01,539
<i>Being a whore is a bit like
being an actress, I suppose.</i>

1648
01:38:02,507 --> 01:38:05,577
You have to pretend
you're someone else.

1649
01:38:05,610 --> 01:38:08,647
Someone that's not you.

1650
01:38:08,680 --> 01:38:10,749
I'd pretend
I was somewhere else.

1651
01:38:10,782 --> 01:38:12,450
<i>It's too late for you.</i>

1652
01:38:12,484 --> 01:38:14,686
That this wasn't
happening to me.

1653
01:38:15,854 --> 01:38:18,790
<i>Try and forget all those...</i>

1654
01:38:18,823 --> 01:38:21,526
<i>All those men.</i>

1655
01:38:21,559 --> 01:38:24,230
<i>Their faces.</i>

1656
01:38:24,263 --> 01:38:25,697
I'd blank them out.

1657
01:38:27,099 --> 01:38:28,600
I had to.

1658
01:38:30,001 --> 01:38:32,570
<i>Make like they were nothing.</i>

1659
01:38:33,772 --> 01:38:39,811
So, yes, you could say
sandie died in that room.

1660
01:38:41,846 --> 01:38:45,151
She died in that room
a hundred times.

1661
01:38:45,184 --> 01:38:46,818
And then one night...

1662
01:38:49,121 --> 01:38:50,855
The man who put me there...

1663
01:38:54,060 --> 01:38:55,961
The man who put me to work...

1664
01:38:58,697 --> 01:39:00,999
The man who stole my dream...

1665
01:39:05,171 --> 01:39:06,238
Well...

1666
01:39:09,208 --> 01:39:10,942
I put a knife in him...

1667
01:39:14,879 --> 01:39:16,481
A hundred times.

1668
01:39:20,319 --> 01:39:22,221
And do you know what, Ellie?

1669
01:39:22,254 --> 01:39:24,923
Oh, I can call you Ellie,
can't I?

1670
01:39:24,956 --> 01:39:26,024
Yeah.

1671
01:39:26,058 --> 01:39:27,892
It felt right, Ellie.

1672
01:39:30,996 --> 01:39:33,598
All those bastards

1673
01:39:33,631 --> 01:39:36,001
<i>who came ringing my bell,</i>

1674
01:39:36,035 --> 01:39:38,570
<i>creeping up my stairs,</i>

1675
01:39:38,603 --> 01:39:41,307
they sent me to hell, so...

1676
01:39:41,340 --> 01:39:43,641
I sent them to theirs.

1677
01:39:48,147 --> 01:39:49,981
The papers call them

1678
01:39:50,015 --> 01:39:52,318
<i>missing persons.</i>

1679
01:39:52,351 --> 01:39:55,754
As far as I'm concerned,
they were already lost.

1680
01:39:57,323 --> 01:40:01,559
So they don't know
where they are.

1681
01:40:02,660 --> 01:40:05,097
I say they didn't know
who they were.

1682
01:40:06,664 --> 01:40:08,967
I was doing everyone a favor.

1683
01:40:09,000 --> 01:40:12,637
I wasn't gonna be used anymore.

1684
01:40:12,670 --> 01:40:15,274
I wasn't gonna let
this city break me.

1685
01:40:15,307 --> 01:40:17,809
I'm so sorry.

1686
01:40:17,842 --> 01:40:18,943
Why?

1687
01:40:18,977 --> 01:40:21,280
It's not your fault.

1688
01:40:21,313 --> 01:40:24,283
No, I mean I understand.

1689
01:40:24,316 --> 01:40:26,718
I know what you've been through.

1690
01:40:26,751 --> 01:40:27,919
Oh.

1691
01:40:27,952 --> 01:40:30,089
Do you, now?

1692
01:40:30,122 --> 01:40:33,658
Yeah, I didn't mean to get you
in trouble with the police.

1693
01:40:33,691 --> 01:40:35,960
Oh, it's all right.

1694
01:40:35,994 --> 01:40:37,962
They think you're mad.

1695
01:40:37,996 --> 01:40:40,865
And it's not like
you're gonna tell anyone else.

1696
01:40:40,899 --> 01:40:42,201
No. No, I'm not.

1697
01:40:42,234 --> 01:40:44,303
Of course not. I-I would never.

1698
01:40:44,336 --> 01:40:47,806
No. I mean...

1699
01:40:47,839 --> 01:40:51,043
I know you're not
going to tell anyone else.

1700
01:41:00,086 --> 01:41:03,955
Oh, don't worry. I'm not gonna
stab you like the others.

1701
01:41:03,988 --> 01:41:07,293
I wouldn't do that to you. No.

1702
01:41:07,326 --> 01:41:09,161
You're gonna go to sleep.

1703
01:41:10,396 --> 01:41:13,032
And everyone will think you
just topped yourself because,

1704
01:41:13,065 --> 01:41:16,135
you know, they all thought you
were going to do that anyway.

1705
01:41:17,436 --> 01:41:21,107
They're all very concerned
about you.

1706
01:41:21,140 --> 01:41:23,608
Bless.

1707
01:41:24,876 --> 01:41:27,679
So, you...

1708
01:41:27,712 --> 01:41:32,184
Just get comfy, and...

1709
01:41:32,218 --> 01:41:35,087
You can doze off

1710
01:41:35,121 --> 01:41:38,224
listening to some of
that nice music of yours.

1711
01:41:39,891 --> 01:41:42,394
No more excitement
for you tonight.

1712
01:41:52,338 --> 01:41:54,306
Just you, is it?

1713
01:41:54,340 --> 01:41:56,007
Little liar!

1714
01:42:02,214 --> 01:42:03,748
No.

1715
01:42:03,781 --> 01:42:06,684
Just coming, deary.

1716
01:42:28,307 --> 01:42:30,276
What is it?

1717
01:42:30,309 --> 01:42:32,810
Um, I'm here to see Ellie.

1718
01:42:32,844 --> 01:42:35,780
She's upstairs. Come on in.

1719
01:42:39,218 --> 01:42:40,885
Run!

1720
01:42:41,387 --> 01:42:44,089
John!

1721
01:42:45,457 --> 01:42:47,059
Will you keep it down!

1722
01:42:47,092 --> 01:42:49,827
